# AVIXA Design Guidelines and Company Best Practices

## Huddle Rooms (2-4 People)
- **Display Size:** The primary display should be a minimum of 55 inches for comfortable viewing at a distance of 1.5 to 2 meters.
- **Audio:** An all-in-one video bar with integrated microphones and speakers is sufficient. The microphone array should have a pickup range of at least 4 meters.
- **Camera:** The camera must have a wide field of view (FOV) of at least 110 degrees to capture all participants in the room. 4K resolution is preferred.
- **Connectivity:** Must provide a simple, single-cable connection (like USB-C or HDMI with USB) for users to bring their own device (BYOD).
- **Control:** For rooms with a dedicated PC, a touch controller (like the Poly TC8 or Logitech Tap) is required for easy meeting control.

## Medium Conference Rooms (5-10 People)
- **Display Size:** Requires a larger display, typically 65 to 75 inches. For rooms longer than 6 meters, consider dual displays.
- **Audio:** A dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) is recommended for better audio quality. Use ceiling or table microphones for even coverage. Avoid using the display's built-in speakers.
- **Camera:** A PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera is necessary to focus on the active speaker.
